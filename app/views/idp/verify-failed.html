      <ul class='list-bullet'>
        <li>there isn't enough information about you on your credit file or financial history</li>
        <li>the details you provided don't match the information held by the DVLA, HM Passports Office or credit agencies</li>

      <p>Your credit score has not been affected in any way during this process.</p>
